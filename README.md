# 3x2-keyboard
I made a project of a 3x2 keyboard based on Xiao RP2040. I chose this size so I don't have to use matrix to wire the switches, It uses only 6 pins so there is still room for other things. I also added a rotary encoder ec11 for controlling volume. I already made the pcb in Kicad, I will try making the case soon and lastly the code.
