# 3x2 keyboard
I made a project of a 3x2 keyboard based on Xiao RP2040. I chose this size so I don't have to use matrix to wire the switches, they use only 6 pins so there is still room for other things so I also added a rotary encoder ec11 for controlling volume.

# In the project I'm using:
## 1x Ec11 rotary encoder
## 1x Custom made PCB
## 6x Cherry MX switches
## 6x Blank DSA keycaps
